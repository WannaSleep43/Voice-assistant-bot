# Sirius AI Assistant Bot

Part of my work on developing a voice assistant bot for Telegram, completed during the project session at Sirius.

This bot has the ability to recognize speech from voice messages, as well as the ability to respond to user requests by voice. It also has a small database, thanks to which it can give out some funny jokes
